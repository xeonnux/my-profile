This is my personal website. After travelling the world and trying out tonnes of new skills and jobs, I decided 5 years ago to get back to what I love the most. This is the site that showcase my journey that started 3 years ago when I decided to consolidate my knowledge and out of the blue do [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.org/) bootcamp and build myself a new stable life doing what I love the most.

## Getting Started

my Static markdown page generator is based on 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
